# Project2_Group2

## Define the Problem

Our project group is focused on enhancing the success rates of addiction / recovery treatment programs utilized by facilities such as the House of Hope. We will begin by identifying and analyzing key factors that contribute to higher or lower completion rates. With current data showing that only 42.1% of patients complete their treatment program, our immediate goal is to develop a model to help improve predictions of client success rates based on an intake questionnaire. Future goals would include training a model to recommend strategies that can significantly improve patient retention and success, thereby increasing the overall effectiveness and impact of these crucial treatment programs.

## Data collection

Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive
Get Access: NSDUH Restricted-use Data SAMHSA has partnered with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to host restricted-use National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data at their Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (RDCs). RDCs are secure facilities that provide access to a range of restricted-use microdata for statistical purposes. SAMHSA is the most recent federal partner to work with NCHS in making NSDUH restricted-use microdata available to approved researchers at RDC sites.
