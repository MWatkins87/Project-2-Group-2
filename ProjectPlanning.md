# Project2_Group2

## Define the Problem

Our project group is focused on enhancing the success rates of treatment programs by identifying and analyzing key factors that contribute to higher completion rates. With current data showing that only 42.1% of patients complete their treatment, we aim to leverage advanced data analysis techniques to uncover actionable insights. Our goal is to develop and recommend strategies that can significantly improve patient retention and success, thereby increasing the overall effectiveness and impact of these crucial treatment programs.
